Day 2: September 12, 2020 17 - 30

-like the complete lack of classes
-SqAttacked seems hefty, recalculating things
-any reason for bool.true? rather than just true
-elegant bit storage
-represents everything with numbers which is really cool as opposed to classes 
-too many arrays to represent different things, knights and kings as non sliding pieces is probably unnecessary
-not a fan of writing this gigantic function without tests
