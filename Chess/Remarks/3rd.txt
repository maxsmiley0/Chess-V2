-made add piece and clear piece but didn't even implement in move piece?

-i had a way harder time distinguishing legal moves from pseudo legal moves (compare times)
-takeback move as opposed to seeing if its not legal? interesting, i wonder if introduction to ponder would see faster calculations
-perf testing is really smart and robust
